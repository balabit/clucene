------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code.
These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache
License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute
their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*
licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your
needs.

To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear:
CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
        *or*
the Apache License, Version 2.0

However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL
license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing
of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both
for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use theGPL.

You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only
question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different
ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the
licenseused, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or
added features.

Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions
package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for
more information.
